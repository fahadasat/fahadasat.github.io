        <h3> Project Summary </h3>
        <h4>
            The Autonomous Vehicle Tennis Ball Collector (AVTBC) was a semester impractical 
            but fun group project during the Covid-19 lockdown involving Kyle Keislar, 
            Nolan Mirras, Igor Vdovchenko, and yours truly. The goal of this project was to 
            collect and return tennis balls from a standard tennis court. The project utilizes 
            a variety of sensory and image processing technologies including ultranosin and 
            smart vision sensors. The AVTBC consists of a basket and robotic arm mounted to 
            a small electric car for mobile ball collection and storage.

        <h3> Detailed Project Description </h3>
        <h4>
            This project is summed up into 5 high level systems:
            <ul class = "bit-sections">
                <li> Drivetrain System </li>
                <li> Ball Detection System </li>
                <li> Ball Acquisition System </li>
                <li> Microcontroller Navigation & Control System </li>
                <li> Power System </li>
            </ul>
            
            <br /> <u> Drivetrain System: </u> <br /> <br />

            This system uses the osoyoo robotic car with modified battery and motors. 
            The design decisions that came into play into choosing this car included power, 
            weight, and mobility. This arduino interfacing model allowed for easier chassis 
            modification and high torque performance for the increased weight the basket 
            and tennis balls would bring. <br /> <br />

            <u> Ball Detection System: </u> <br /> <br />

            For this system two main sensors were used. For the long distance sensor network 
            a mesh of ultrasonic sensors were used as they were cheap, lightweight, and had 
            a detection radius of greater than 10 inches. For the shorter distances a Pixy2 
            Smart Vision Sensor was able to do the trick. This lightweight and compact smart 
            sensor is capable of tracking multiple objects, has integrated arduino capability, 
            and specializes in color detection. <br /> <br />

            <u> Ball Acquisition System: </u> <br /> <br />

            This system includes an acquisition and storage device. A robotic arm called Lewan 
            Soul xArm, dubbed Armen, was used to pick up the tennis balls while a simple, cheap, 
            and lightweight basket was screwed for the ball collection. The biggest weight for 
            the car would be the robotic arm so the main considerations when picking armen was 
            size, weight, power, and range of motion. Armen met the requirements and included a 
            board that supplied the power and data the servos required. Armen utilizes TTL on 
            the TX and RX pins and a proprietary protocol for communication between the arduino 
            and arm. <br /> <br />

            <u> Microcontroller Navigation & Control System: </u> <br /> <br />

            The navigation and control system was based on a routine state diagram given below. 
            When placed on the tennis court the robot will patrol in a straight line. Once the 
            object is detected the pixy camera will confirm if it is a tennis ball. Once in 
            position the arm will go through it’s retrieval subroutine and place it on the 
            basket. The car will then return to the previous patrol point and resume patrol. 
            <br /> <br />

            <br /> <u> Power System: </u> <br /> <br />

            The power system must be able to power the car’s motors, Armen’s servos, and 
            arduino with the sensors. They will also need to have the capacity to continuously 
            operate for one court sweep. Using two LiPo high discharge 3.8V rechargeable batteries 
            the costs were able to stay inexpensive. However, the operational time will put a 
            significant drain on the 2.2 A/hr battery pack. Another battery pack is being 
            considered as well as adding mosfet switches with the logic control coming from the 
            arduino.  <br /> <br />
