        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <h4>
          This project was created to help with the Japanese minor I was
          planning on getting. After two years of studying Japanese I realized
          that I would like to have my practice tools other than speaking on the
          same platform. This application allowed me to study vocabulary, kanji,
          listening, reading, and writing with levels ranging from elementary to
          busines.

        <h3>Tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.</h3>
        <h4>Java, JFC/Swing</h4>
        <h3>Detailed Project Description</h3>
        <h4>
          This app was created with Java as the logic and JFC/Swing as the GUI.
          The app allows for the user to train in N5 which is elementary level
          all the way through N1 business level. <br />The vocabulary would
          allow the user to choose whether they would like to start off with
          English or Japanese first and supply the vocab from popular N5-N1
          vocabulary charts. <br />
          The Kanji section is created similar to the vocabulary except with
          Kanji/Hiragana instead of English/Hiragana. <br />
          The listening section provides the user with a one sentence Japanese
          audio transcript that the user needs to translate. <br />
          The reading section presents a paragraph that the user needs to read
          and translate. <br />
          The writing section gives the user a english passage that will need to
          be translated into Japanese.
