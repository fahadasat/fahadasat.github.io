        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <h4>
          The inspiration for this project came with the need of not wanting to
          have to run across my university campus to get to the next class. At
          the time I didnâ€™t have or know how to ride a longboard, so the first
          step was creating the actual board. Next step was practicing before
          making the longboard eclectic, and finally converting the longboard to
          be electric.
        </h4>
        <h3>Tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.</h3>
        <h4>Soldering Gun, Power Drill, Circular Saw</h4>
        <h3>Detailed Project Description</h3>
        <h4>
          To create the longboard three pieces of plywood was glued and clamped
          together until the glue was completely dry. The longboard template was
          found online, printed, and marked on the wood. After the markings were
          complete, the wood was cut and after installing the grip tape and
          wheels the board was complete. <br /><br />
          The next step was practice to ride the board which consisted of help
          from my husky. Strapping a harness on the dog and holding onto the
          leash while on the longboard I quickly learned how to brake, fall,
          turn, and finally not crash. <br /><br />
          Now to create the electric aspect of the board a few needs needed to
          be bought. The drivetrain consists of the motor, motor mount, motor
          pulley, drive wheel pulley, drive wheel pulley, and motor belt. The
          rest of the build includes an enclosure to fit the electronic speed
          controller, batteries, controller receiver, and all the wiring. The
          motor, motor belts, pulleys, and batteries all play a factor in the
          speed and distance the longboard can handle. For example, a higher
          lipo cell count allows faster speed while higher mAh allows for
          greater distance. <br />
          <br />In the end a low-mid cost build was designed to run comfortably
          at 12 mph over 6 miles before needing to be recharged. After the
          casing was drilled onto the underside of the longboard, the drivetrain
          was then assembled onto the rear truck. Finally, the wires were
          soldered between the speed controller, batteries, and motor before the
          electric longboard was finally rideable.
